### NCAA Men's Basketball Game Winning Prediction

Basketball is a sport that involves 10 players on a hardwood surface at one time. In the college game, 5 players from each team attempt to get a ball in a basket while trying to prevent the other team from doing so. In college, the basketball court is 94 feet long and 50 feet wide. The basketball hoop is 10 feet above the ground with a 6 foot wide, 42 inch tall backboard. The basketball rim is 18 inches in diameter. There are five positions in basketball. There is the guard, shooting guard, small forward, forward, and center positions. These positions are also referred to as positions 1 through 5. Usually the 1 (guard) position is the shortest player on the team, and best ball handler. The 1 usually handles the ball the most and runs the teams offense. Positions 4 and 5 are usually the tallest players on the team and collect the most rebounds.

The above is an oversimplification of the game as a team is made up of approximately 15 players, at varying positions, with varying skills, making varying contributions to the game. Every year, hundreds of Men's college basketball teams play at least 25 games in a season. As one can imagine, the playing of these games creates a multitude of stats that can be analyzed. The objective of this experiment is to determine, with what accuracy, a machine learning model can predict a win or a loss between two Men's NCAA basketball teams given historical measures. This experiment will be broken as follows:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Model Building (Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks)
5. Model Analysis
6. Summary

#### Data Collection

All data has been gathered from the NCAA Men's Basketball Archived Statistics website
